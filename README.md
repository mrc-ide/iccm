## IMPORTANT NOTES

:warning: This code is released with no support. Please submit any
questions or bugs as [issues](https://github.com/mrc-ide/iccm/issues)
and we will try to address them as quickly as possible.

:warning: This model is in active development and so parameter name and
behaviours, and output file formats will change without notice.

:warning: As with any mathematical model, it is easy to misconfigure
inputs and therefore get meaningless outputs. Please contact the authors
if you intend to publish results using `iccm`.
